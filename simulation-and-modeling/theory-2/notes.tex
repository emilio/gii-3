\section{Mass and spring}
Ver imagen del muelle.

We try to obtain a function \(x(t)\), where \(x\) is the displacement of
the spring, that depends of \(F_a\), the force applied to the mass.

We might have friction, that we'll denote as \(F_f\), with the
corresponding friction coefficient that we'll denote as \(b\).

We know that:

\[ F_d = -k \cdot x \]
\[ F_f = b \cdot v \]
\[ \sum \vec{F} = m \cdot a \]

That gives:

\[ \sum \vec{F} = F_a - F_d - F_f = m \cdot a \]

Substituting \(a\) as \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}\), and later
\(v\) as \(\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}\):

\[ F_a - k \cdot x - b \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = m \cdot \frac{\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}}{\partial t} \]

Simplifying:

% \[ F_a - k \cdot x - b \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = m \cdot \frac{\partial \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}}{\partial t} \]
