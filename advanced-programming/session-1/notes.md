# Oh man, I hate Java, and I hate this course
I'll try not to use an IDE during this course, but I can't promise since Java is so fucking ugly.

I still don't know anything about agents as of right now. The only thing I can say is that my teacher doesn't.

I see them as a kind-of unix daemons, and I find all this Jade boilerplate pretty unuseful right now: If I wanted to pass messages over a network I'll program some sockets.

I hope I can find something interesting in this course...
