# Lineal codes

A block code is lineal if and ondly if the transformation it represents is
lineal.

Remember that a lineal transformation is a transformation $T$ such as:

 * $T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)$
 * $a \cdot T(u) = T(a \cdot u)$

## Reasons to stick with linear codes

Theorical
: Gilbert-Varshamod bound implies that there exist linear codes within the
"good" code families.

Mathematical
: Easier to proof things ($+$, $-$, linear algebra).

Practical
: Easy methods to produce linear transformations.
